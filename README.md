# COMP261 Tutorial 1

This code is for the discussion of data structures and starting to play with moving things around

This code has both an Edge Adjacency List and an [Adjacency Matrix line 11 Graph.java](/src/comp261/tut1/Graph.java#L11) `[Adjacency Matrix line 11 Graph.java](/src/comp261/tut1/Graph.java#L11)`

I will add addtional comments in here to help students with the code as questions come up
